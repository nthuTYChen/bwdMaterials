			/* Choose the simplest selector that targets exactly at all <span> elements that are children of all but last <article> element, and these <article> elements must also be siblings of any <footer> element that is also the immediate child of the <body> element. */

			/* Wrongly applies to nothing because none of the <article>s is enclosed inside <footer> */
			/*body > footer article:not(:last-of-type) > span {
				background-color: yellow;
			}*/

			/* Wrongly applies to only <span>s that are immediate children of the last <article> */
			/*body > footer ~ article:last-of-type span {
				background-color: yellow;
			}*/

			/* Wrongly applies to only <span>s that are immediate children of all but last <article> */
			/*body > footer ~ article:not(:last-of-type) > span {
				background-color: yellow;
			}*/

			body > footer ~ article:not(:last-of-type) span {
				background-color: yellow;
