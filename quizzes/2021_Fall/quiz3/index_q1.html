			/* Choose the simplest selector that targets exactly at the first line of every <p> element that is the first element immediately included in any <section> element, and the <section> element must also be adjacent to an <h1> that is a child of any <article> element. */

			/* Wrongly applies to all <p>s inside <section> */
			/*article > h1 + section p:first-of-type::first-/line {

			}*/

			/* Wrongly applies to all but the last <p>s inside <section> */
			/*article h1 + section p:first-child::first-line {

			/* Correct answer */
			/*article h1 + section > p:first-child::first-line { 
				background-color: yellow;
