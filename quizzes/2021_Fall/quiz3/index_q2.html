			/* Choose the simplest selector that targets exactly at all <section> elements that are immediate children of a first <article> element that is also a sibling next to a <nav> element. */

			/* Wrongly applies to nothing. Although Nav #1 is next to Article #1, Nav #1 occurs AFTER Article #1 */
			/*article:first-of-type + nav > section {
				background-color: yellow;
			}*/

			/* Correct answer  */
			nav + article:first-of-type > section {

			/* Wrongly applies to Section #1 if another element appears between Nav #1 and Article #1 */

			}*/

			/* Wrongly applies to Section #1 and Section #2 */
