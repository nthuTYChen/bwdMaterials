		<!-- In the two sections below, we choose to put an emphasis on different parts of the texts with <em>. But for some of the emphasized texts, we want to make them stand out even more, which include "HTML" and "XML" is the first section and "reduces complexity and repetition" in the second section. However, "HTML" and "XML" are the second and the last <em> in the first section, and "reduces complexity and repetition" is the last <em> in the second section. It is thus not possible to find any structural similarity between these <em>s. To have a CSS setting applied to these three <em>s, we still need to use the "class" attribute (i.e., "extra") to manually group them together, and then apply a CSS setting to this particular class. So, it is not that you can never use "class" or "id" for HTML elements but that you only use them when you cannot apply a CSS setting to one or a group of HTML elements based on the structure of the HTML document. -->

			<section><em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as <em class="extra">HTML</em> or <em class="extra">XML</em> (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</section>
			<section>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including <em>layout</em>, <em>colors</em>, and <em>fonts</em>.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which <em class="extra">reduces complexity and repetition</em> in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</section>
