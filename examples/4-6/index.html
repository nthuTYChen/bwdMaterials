			<section><em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as <em class="extra">HTML</em> or <em class="extra">XML</em> (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</section>
			<section>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including <em>layout</em>, <em>colors</em>, and <em>fonts</em>.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which <em class="extra">reduces complexity and repetition</em> in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</section>
