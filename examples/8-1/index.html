			/* The new value of a variable does not have to be the same data type.
			   For example, you can assign a string to the variable "num", even if
			   the previous value is numeric. However, this practice is NOT
			   recommended, because you will get confused very easily with the data
			   stored in a variable. */

			// you will get "105" as a string, since the numeric value is
			// converted into a string before being concantenated with "5".
			console.log(num + str);

			/* On the right side of =, addition applies from left to right,

			// So, the value assogned to "test2" is "Value: 50".
			console.log(test2);

			/* You can only use operators like -, /, * for numeric values.
			   Thus, the attempt to "substract" a letter "A" from the entire
			   string "Get rid of A" is bound to fail. */

			// which means "Not a Number".
