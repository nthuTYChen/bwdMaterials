			// If it is bad to mix different data types in an array,
			// it seems we can only use different variables for data
			// that have different meanings.
			var name = 'TY Chen', age = 39, affiliation = 'NTHU';

			// But no, we can actually have a highly structured container
			// for data that are relevant, which is called an "object"
			// defined using {} (which is similar to a code block). 
			var profile = {
				// In an object, you can define a "key" and its "value",
				// which is separated with a colon ":". Every two keys
				// are separated with a comma.
				name: 'TY Chen',
				age: 39,
				affiliation: 'NTHU',
				height: 180,
				weight: 72,
				// You can have an object for a key inside an object, too!
				contact: {

					mobile: [937846567, 911678134, 967856717]

			// You can get the value of a key using "object.key".
			console.log(profile.name);
			// Or, you can use "object[key]" as well, in which the name of the "key"
			// is specified with a string.
			console.log(profile['name']);

			// You can assign a new value to an existing key...
			profile.name = 'Tsung-Ying Chen';
			// or you can also create a new key and assign a value to it.
			profile.gender = 'Male';

			// Check the entire object in your console.
			console.log(profile);

			// When you reach the "mobile" key of the "contact" key of the "profile"
			// object, you get an array. Then, with [1], you can get the second value
			// of the array.
			console.log(profile.contact.mobile[1]);
