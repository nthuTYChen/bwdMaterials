		<!-- How to have a different menu design in desktop and 
			 mobile browser? This example demonstrates the first
			 solution, that is, to have two copies of the same
			 menu specified with a different ID, and then use
			 separate CSS settings to style each copy. Then, we
			 present a different menu based on the viewport width.

		<!-- Note that this approach has to be used with caution - you 
			 certainly don't want to have two copies of everything in
			 your website. That will be a bad Web design practice.
