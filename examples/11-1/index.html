				// Then, the number representing the last position would be the length minus 1. Why?
				// Because the first position starts at 0.
				let lastPos = arrayLength - 1;

				/* Our "lastP" is obtained with the standard JS function getElementById. jQuery functions
				   CANNOT be applied to any HTML element retrieved using a standard JS function. Therefore,
				   you will see an error message saying that "lastP.eq is NOT a function", because "lastP"
				   is not a jQuery search result, so of course "lastP" is not a jQuery object that comes
				   with an eq() function.
