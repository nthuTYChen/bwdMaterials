			// Declare a variable storing an array of 5 numeric values,
			// which is defined using [], in which every two values are
			// separated by a comma.
			var numArray = [1, 5, 2, 11, 7];

			/* To get a value out of an array, you need to specify the 
			   index number (or, position) of the value in an array. 
			   The index number begins with 0. */
			// Get the first value of the array
			console.log(numArray[0]);
			// Get the third value of the array
			console.log(numArray[2]);

			// You can assign a new value to a specific position of an array
			numArray[1] = 18;
			console.log(numArray[1]);

			// Just check the entire array
			console.log(numArray);

			/* JS allows you to mix different types of data in the SAME array,
			   But this is a BAD PRACTICE, since it's not easy for you to 
			   recall which position represents which data. */
			var mixedArray = [1, 'Hello!', 'yes!', 9, 87];
			/* For example, the "profile" array mixes strings and numbers
			   together, and you will have to remember "the first position
			   is the name", "the second position is the affiliation", etc.,
			   which just does not make much sense. */
			var profile = ['TY Chen', 'NTHU', 180, 72];

			/* So, a GOOD practice is to use the same array to store the same
			   type of data, such as the one below used to store multiple phone
			   numbers. Regardless of whether it is the first, second, or third
			   number, it always represents a phone number. */
			var phoneNumbers = [937133678, 95611148, 982282143];

			// It is possible to create an "empty" array...
			var emptyArray = [];
			// ...and directly "insert" a value into a specific position.
			emptyArray[0] = 1;
			console.log(emptyArray);

			// What if you skip a position when "inserting" a value into an array...?
			emptyArray[2] = 15;
			// Check it yourself, but don't do this on a regular basis. In general,
			// you should not skip any position when inserting a value into an array.
			console.log(emptyArray);
