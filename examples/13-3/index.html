			/* This example works on a CSS design the hides the texts of an element by
			   reducing the width (or height) of the element with an animation that
			   shows the texts by restoring the full width (or height) of the element.
			   Why is this necessary, you ask, if we can set "opacity" to zero and also
			   hide the entire element and its texts? The reason is that even if you
			   set opacity to zero, the element does not disappear; it only becomes
			   fully transparent and could still block the contents under it. Thus,
			   to hide/show one element and its text completely, it is better to
			   adjust the width (or height) of the element. And to achieve this, we
			   need to use the CSS "overflow" and "white-space" properties.

			/* For the first sample DIV  */
			div:first-of-type {
				width: 100px;
				background-color: red;
				color: white;
				font-family: sans-serif;
				transition: all 0.3s linear;

			/* Common CSS settings for all <div> elements */
			div {
				/* Add top/bottom margins so every two <div> elements are separated 
				   by a vertical gap.
				*/
				margin: 20px 0;
				background-color: red;
				color: black;
			}

			/* The second <div> is set to only have a width of 100px, which is not
			   enough for all the texts to appear in the same line. The "long" word
			   goes beyond the boundary, and the <div> becomes taller because
			   words are pushed to the second and even the third line.
			 */
			div:nth-of-type(2) {
				width: 100px;
			}

			/* With a slightly longer width, there are only two lines in the third <div>
			   , but it is still not very satisfying.
			 */
			div:nth-of-type(3) {
				width: 250px;
			}

			/* With 350px, finally all the words could be presented in one single line in
			   the fourth <div>. Without additional settings, the second to the fourth <div>
			   simulate the gradual expansion of the long texts in a small block, and 
			   visually it is far from perfect, because we don't need any change in the height
			   of the <div> in the expansion process, and we want no texts going beyond the
			   <div> at any given point.
			 */
			div:nth-of-type(4) {
				width: 350px;
			}

			/* The fifth <div> simulates the animated version of the above process when the mouse 
			   moves across the <div>. 
			*/
			div:nth-of-type(5) {
				width: 10px;
			}

			div:nth-of-type(5):hover {
				width: 350px;
				transition: all 5s linear;
			}

			/* To make things work, let's add "overflow" and "white-space" properties
			   to the sixth <div>
			 */
			div:nth-of-type(6) {
				width: 100px;
				/* As we set "overflow-x" to be hidden, the first change is that the texts 
				   that go beyond (i.e., overflow) the right edge of the block simply disappear.
				*/
				overflow-x: hidden;
				/* The "white-space" control how texts are arranged when there are white spaces.
				   When we set it to "nowrap", it means that the whole texts are presented in a
				   single line, and texts won't break into multiple lines even when a white space
				   meets the edge of an element.
				*/
				white-space: nowrap;
			}

			/* The seventh <div> demonstrates the animated version that gradually expands 
			   the hidden texts as the width increases when the mouse enters it.
			 */
			div:nth-of-type(7) {
				width: 10px;
				overflow-x: hidden;
				white-space: nowrap;
			}

			div:nth-of-type(7):hover {
				width: 350px;
