			   1. The first statement creates a variable that is used only in a loop.
			   2. The second statement is a condition that is checked in the very beginning of
			      each iteration; the loop continues only if the condition is satisfied.
			   3. The third statement is an action taken at the end of every iteration. In the
			      current loop, this statement increase the variable "i" by 1 (++) every single time.
