				/* However, on() is more useful for binding MULTIPLE events to HTML elements at the same time,
				   as long as you separate every two event types with a space.
				   This would be useful especially when dealing with both desktop and mobile browser. For example,
				   some mobile browsers do not react to the mouse event "click" but to gestural events like "touchend".
				   It is thus necessary to bind both "click" and "touchend" for the same interactive effects to work
				   in different contexts.
