			/* In this case, you might also wonder if it also works to call the
			   function BEFORE it is assigned to a variable. The answer is no.
			   When you use "var" to declare a variable, only the declaration part
			   ("var flexibleMsg") is hoisted to the top of a script. Thus, when you
			   try to call the function below, you will get an error saying 
			   "flexibleMsg is not a function". This is true because the function is
			   not assigned to "flexibleMsg" up to this point.*/

			   as a function. */

				let finalMsg = 'Site Message: ' + str;
				alert(finalMsg);

			// Note that declaring a variable using "var" results in "one statement",
			// which, by default, ends with a semi-colon.

			// Call the function AFTER the function is assigned to a variable, and
			// send a string to it. But see line 7...
