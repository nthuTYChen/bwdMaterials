			<h1>Structural Analysis</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>In the opening paragraph [Sec. #1], the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. First, it contains the keyword dementia, which is discussed throughout the entire essay. In addition, the key phrases before symptoms emerge indicates that the focus will be on early detection of dementia.</p>
				<p>Learning your odds of eventually developing dementia — a pressing concern for many, especially those with a family history of it — requires medical testing and counseling. But what if everyday behavior, like overlooking a couple of credit card payments or habitually braking while driving, could foretell your risk? A spate of experiments is underway to explore that possibility, reflecting the growing awareness that the pathologies underlying dementia can begin years or even decades before symptoms emerge.</p>

				<h2>Essay Outline</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>[Sec. #2] - Early detection is better than late treatments
						<p>The topic of this section is made very clear in the first quoted statement in this section Early detection is key, and the rest of the section talks about why early detection is better, which is particularly indicated by the key phrase the drugs are administered too late to be helpful.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Coherence & Cohesion</h2>
				<h3>[Sec. #2]</h3>
				<p>Coherence</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Para #1 - Section #2 is the first paragraph that follows the opening paragraph, so its first paragraph naturally carries on to elaborate on the main topic. In the first sentence Early detection is key for intervention..., the key phrase Early detection of dementia is linked back to the main topic of the essay, which creates a natural transition into the subtopic.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Cohesion</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Para #1 - In the second sentence of the first paragraph Such efforts could help..., the author uses the phrase such effort to refer to early detection in the previous sentence, which is a strategy involving the use of demonstrative adjective to emphasize the focus of the current writing.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
				<p>In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author quotes the story of a participant taking part in the studies that investigate early indicators of dementia. In this story, the author's writing implies some positive aspects of understanding whether you have an early development of dementia. For example, the author shows that the odds of Alzheimer's disease is lower than the participant had feared. The author also quotes the participant's positive attitude toward the understanding of the risk despite the need to share their personal data, like I would want to use them. I'd rather know than not. Thus, we can see that in general, the author tries to convince people that there are more advantages than disadvantages to use your personal data to reveal your chance of having dementia and it's better to get fully prepared.</p>
				<p>Paul Gondek, 68, who lives in Philadelphia and teaches social psychology at Drexel University, chose to learn his risk status two years ago, volunteering for several studies at the Penn Memory Center. Alzheimer’s tends to run in families and, having watched his mother’s slow decline from the disease, he knew he had a higher chance of developing it. To Mr. Gondek’s relief, the PET scan showed that he did not have elevated amounts of amyloid in his brain. And a calculated risk score showed that his odds of Alzheimer’s by age 85 were about 19 percent — higher than the 11 percent risk for the general population, but lower than he had feared. If other early indicators were available through driving or financial records or other behaviors and were reliable, he said, “I would want to use them. I’d rather know than not.”</p>
